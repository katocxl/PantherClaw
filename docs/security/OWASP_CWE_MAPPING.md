# PantherClaw — OWASP / CWE Baseline Mapping (SG13)

**Selected:** 2026-10-08 (G0). **Editions:** OWASP Top 10:2025 · OWASP API Security Top 10 2023 · OWASP ASVS 5.0.0 (L2; L3 for V6–V11) · OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications 2026 · CWE Top 25 2025 · MITRE ATLAS (detections). Category names were taken from the published editions; re-verify wording at each milestone G0.

**Status vocabulary (SG14):** `Planned` · `In progress` · `Implemented (pending verification)` · `Verified` (test evidence for the stated revision) · `Exception` · `N/A (justified)`. Nothing starts as Verified.

## 3. OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications (2026) — product coverage

PantherClaw is itself a mitigation product for these risks; this table maps what the product enforces for customers.

| Risk | PantherClaw mitigation | Pillar |
|---|---|---|
| ASI01 Agent Goal Hijack | Goals cannot expand authority: task grants, sequence rules, holds, detections | 5, 8, 12 |
| ASI02 Tool Misuse & Exploitation | Reviewed action meaning, parameter constraints, budgets, approvals | 5, 6, 8 |
| ASI03 Identity & Privilege Abuse | PAP/1 workload identity, launcher ≠ principal, no name-based inheritance, delegation lattice | 4, 5 |
| ASI04 Agentic Supply Chain Vulnerabilities | Signed tool packages, reviewed descriptions, drift quarantine | 6, 16 |
| ASI05 Unexpected Code Execution | Shell/host routes governed, sandbox, coverage states | 16, 17 |
| ASI06 Memory & Context Poisoning | Agent memory is never evidence of history/authority (F126); trusted facts only | 5, 8 |
| ASI07 Insecure Inter-Agent Communication | Child agents get own identities and narrowed grants; delegation lineage | 4, 5 |
| ASI08 Cascading Failures | Fail-closed, circuit breakers, kill switch, dependency previews | 6, 10, 14 |
| ASI09 Human-Agent Trust Exploitation | Template-only approval rendering, untrusted text quarantine, WebAuthn binding | 7 |
| ASI10 Rogue Agents | Discovery, admission, containment, detections | 2, 10, 12 |

## 6. MITRE ATLAS (detection mapping)

Detections (pillar 12) carry ATLAS technique references where applicable (e.g. LLM prompt injection — direct/indirect, LLM plugin compromise, exfiltration via ML inference API, erode ML model integrity). The mapping table lives with each detection rule in `internal/detections/rules/` and is exported in OCSF findings.
