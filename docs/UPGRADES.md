# PantherClaw — Free Stack Now, Upgrades Later

Everything in the MVP runs at **$0 recurring cost** on the founder's machine plus free tiers. Each upgrade below lists the trigger, the exact change, and the expected cost. Ports/adapters were designed so upgrades are configuration or adapter swaps, not rewrites.
