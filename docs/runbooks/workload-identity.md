# Workload identity (PAP/1)

**Milestone:** M3 · **Owner:** the org's Identity Publisher and agent owners · **Status:** tested procedure (M3 end-to-end tests)

How an agent's workload gets an identity PantherClaw can verify: enrollment with an owner's token, or L2 attestation from GitHub Actions or Kubernetes. Background: [PAP-1](../protocol/PAP-1.md) §3–§5, [ADR-0018](../adr/0018-federated-workload-identity-and-represented-principals.md), [g0/M3.md](../g0/M3.md).

## 1. Enroll with an owner's token (any workload)

1. The owner creates the agent and a single-use enrollment token (15 minutes):
   ```bash
   pclaw agent create --name coder --team <team> --env <env> --owner <user> --context service
   pclaw agent enroll-token <agent> --out enroll.token
   ```
2. On the workload, create a key (it never leaves the machine) and enroll:
   ```bash
   pclaw workload init --key-file workload.json
   pclaw workload enroll --key-file workload.json --server https://pantherclaw.example.com --enrollment-token-file enroll.token
   ```
   The command prints the instance id and the key fingerprint.
3. The owner compares the fingerprint through a separate channel, then admits the instance:
   ```bash
   pclaw instance admit <instance> --fingerprint <fingerprint>
   ```
4. The workload gets 10-minute workload tokens with `pclaw workload token --key-file workload.json` and signs every request (the PantherClaw clients do this; see `internal/identity/workloadclient`).

A reused or expired enrollment token is refused and audited. A wrong fingerprint is refused: admit nothing you cannot match.

### Desktop MCP clients (`pclaw mcp proxy`, M6)

An MCP client on a developer's machine (an IDE or a desktop assistant) reaches a gateway connection through `pclaw mcp proxy`. The client starts the proxy as a stdio MCP server. The proxy signs every request with the enrolled desktop key (L1, HR-092) in the run you give it, and posts it to the gateway's `/mcp/{connection}`. It never opens a listener, so nothing else on the machine can borrow the workload's identity through it. Its diagnostics go to stderr. Configure the client like this:

```json
{"mcpServers": {"payments": {"command": "pclaw", "args": ["mcp", "proxy", "--gateway", "https://gateway.example.com",
  "--connection", "payments", "--key-file", "/home/dev/.pantherclaw/workload.json", "--run", "<run id>"]}}}
```

The proxy renews the workload token every 4 minutes. It speaks MCP 2026-07-28 or 2025-11-25, whichever the client does, and opens a new 2025-11-25 session by itself when the gateway ends one. Held calls come back as tasks when the client supports them (G0 M6 design decision 15).

## 2. GitHub Actions (L2)

1. An admin proposes an entry that pins the repository and owner **ids** (never names) and the workflow refs:
   ```bash
   pclaw issuer propose-github --agent <agent> --repository-id 123456 --owner-id 7890 \
     --workflow-ref octo-org/agent-repo/.github/workflows/agent.yml@refs/heads/main \
     --auto-admit --reason "CI agent"
   ```
   Find the ids with `gh api repos/OWNER/REPO --jq '.id, .owner.id'`. For a reusable workflow use `--job-type reusable-workflow` and pin `--workflow-sha`.
2. A person with the **Identity Publisher** role reviews what the proposal widens and activates it (`pclaw issuer activate ENTRY REVISION`; add `--confirm-reusable-refs-protected` for reusable workflows after checking that each ref is a protected branch or tag of its repository).
3. In the workflow (on a protected branch or tag; the preset refuses `pull_request`, `pull_request_target` and any `refs/pull/` ref):
   ```yaml
   permissions:
     id-token: write
     contents: read
   steps:
     - run: pclaw workload init --key-file "$RUNNER_TEMP/workload.json"
     - run: pclaw workload enroll --key-file "$RUNNER_TEMP/workload.json" --server "$PANTHERCLAW_SERVER" --github --org "$PANTHERCLAW_ORG"
   ```
   With `--auto-admit` active the instance is admitted at once; otherwise it waits for the owner. To stay at L2, renew with `pclaw workload token --github`.

### Agents that must look at pull requests (founder decision 1)

Do not run the agent **in** the pull request. Run it from a workflow on the protected branch that reads the pull request as data, triggered by a maintainer:

```yaml
on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
jobs:
  review:
    if: github.event.issue.pull_request && startsWith(github.event.comment.body, '/review') &&
        contains(fromJSON('["OWNER","MEMBER","COLLABORATOR"]'), github.event.comment.author_association)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      pull-requests: write
      contents: read
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5   # checks out the default branch: the bot's own reviewed code
      - run: ./review-bot --pr "${{ github.event.issue.number }}"   # reads the PR through the API, as untrusted data
```

A label (`pull_request` with `types: [labeled]` cannot be used: it runs the PR's code) or a `workflow_run` trigger works the same way. The pull request's content is untrusted input; the bot's authority comes only from its grants (M4).

## 3. Kubernetes (L2)

1. The operator lists each cluster in the server configuration; tenants can only name these:
   ```json
   "identity": {"kubernetes_clusters": [{
     "name": "prod", "api_server": "https://10.0.0.1:6443", "ca_file": "/etc/pantherclaw/prod-ca.pem",
     "token_file": "/etc/pantherclaw/prod-reviewer.token", "allowed_prefixes": ["10.0.0.0/24"],
     "orgs": ["<org id>"]
   }]}
   ```
2. In each cluster, give PantherClaw's reviewer account exactly this (TokenReview, and `get` on pods in the namespaces that entries pin; nothing else):
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: ServiceAccount
   metadata: {name: pantherclaw-reviewer, namespace: pantherclaw}
   ---
   apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
   kind: ClusterRoleBinding
   metadata: {name: pantherclaw-reviewer-tokenreview}
   roleRef: {apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io, kind: ClusterRole, name: system:auth-delegator}
   subjects: [{kind: ServiceAccount, name: pantherclaw-reviewer, namespace: pantherclaw}]
   ---
   apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
   kind: Role
   metadata: {name: pantherclaw-pod-reader, namespace: agents}
   rules: [{apiGroups: [""], resources: [pods], verbs: [get]}]
   ---
   apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
   kind: RoleBinding
   metadata: {name: pantherclaw-pod-reader, namespace: agents}
   roleRef: {apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io, kind: Role, name: pantherclaw-pod-reader}
   subjects: [{kind: ServiceAccount, name: pantherclaw-reviewer, namespace: pantherclaw}]
   ```
   Create the reviewer token with `kubectl -n pantherclaw create token pantherclaw-reviewer --duration 24h` and replace the file before the token expires. The server reads `token_file` again every minute, so a new token needs no restart. Replace the file in one step (write a new file and rename it over the old one): while the file is empty or unreadable, the server keeps using the token it read last.
3. Propose and activate an entry that pins the namespace, the service account **name and UID** (`kubectl -n agents get sa coder -o jsonpath='{.metadata.uid}'`), and optionally image repositories or digests:
   ```bash
   pclaw issuer propose-kubernetes --agent <agent> --cluster prod --namespace agents --service-account coder \
     --service-account-uid <uid> --image-repository ghcr.io/acme/agent --auto-admit --reason "pod agent"
   ```
4. Give the pod a projected token with the org's audience (at most one hour) and enroll with it:
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - name: pantherclaw-token
       projected:
         sources:
           - serviceAccountToken: {path: token, audience: "pantherclaw:<org id>", expirationSeconds: 3600}
   ```
   ```bash
   pclaw workload enroll --key-file /var/run/agent/workload.json --server "$PANTHERCLAW_SERVER" \
     --kubernetes-token /var/run/secrets/pantherclaw/token --org <org id>
   ```
   The image digest PantherClaw records is the pod's, read from the API server; a digest the workload reports is only `declared`.

## 4. When something goes wrong

- **Disable an entry** at once: `pclaw issuer disable ENTRY --reason …`. It stops auto-admission, and its instances drop to L1 at their next token.
- **Revoke an instance**: `pclaw instance revoke INSTANCE --reason …`. Outstanding permits fail at `BeginDispatch`.
- **Unknown keys** reaching the gateway appear as discovered agents (`pclaw agent list --state discovered`); claim, merge or retire them. A `security.discovery_flood` audit event means the per-gateway rate or the per-org cap was reached.
- **Network change alerts** (`security.instance_network_changed`) mean the same key was used from a new network: check whether the key was copied.
